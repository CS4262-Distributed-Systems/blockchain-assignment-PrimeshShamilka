### Smart Contracts in Blockchain

Smart contracts are essentially programs that run when certain criteria are satisfied and are maintained on a blockchain. They're usually used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all parties can be certain of the conclusion right away, without the need for any intermediaries or time waste.


### Distributed Ledger

A distributed ledger is a database that is shared and synchronized by a group of people across many sites, institutions, or countries. It allows for public "witnesses" to be present during transactions. In a couple of seconds or minutes, any modifications or additions to the ledger are reflected and replicated to all participants.
